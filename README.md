# hw-intro

This assignment is mostly reading, plus the index.html that you started in the 1st class...

* Read [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) (MDN)
  * There are 10 pages, 
    * The first one is "Getting started with HTML" 
    * The last one is "Structuring a page of content"
    * Some of you may be familiar with the concepts but you may also find some new things.
    * And it's okay if all of it is new to you.
* Read [CSS first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) (MDN)
  * There are 6 pages
  * The first one is "CSS first steps overview"
  * The last one is "Styling a biography page"
  * This is likely to be new to many of you.
  * We'll review the material and apply it in class.
* Setup your dev environment
  * Make sure you can set up a development environment as discussed in class
  * Look here: http://github.com/git-intro/
* Add an `index.html` file that introduces you to the rest of the class. You started this in the 1st class...
  * This will be the first draft of your own "biography page" -- like the one in the reading.
  * It should contain only information that you're okay with sharing publicly.
  * At a minimum, include your name and a fun fact about yourself.
  * NO STYLING NECESSARY -- You don't need to use any CSS, just the text.
  * When you're done, submit the URL for this repo (i.e., your github-classroom repo) in Canvas.
